# Bottle Image Classification Project
### Team Members: Sydney Simmons, Anna Cameron, Cameron Rondeau

**Purpose of Project:** The problem we are solving through our project is to be able to classify different types of bottles through image classification. We think this could be useful in practical applications, like sorting for recycling. The classes that we are sorting into are beer bottles, water bottles, plastic bottles, wine bottles, and soda bottles.

### Github Notes
Bottle image data used in the image classification saved under the data tab.

3 models tested with separate Jupyter Notebooks were:
1. Baseline CNN
2. ResNet
3. ResMLP
